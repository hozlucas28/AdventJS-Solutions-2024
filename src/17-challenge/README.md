# Challenge 17

The Grinch has been up to his tricks in the North Pole and has planted **explosive coal bombs ğŸ’£** in the elves' toy factory. He wants all the toys to be rendered useless, and that's why he has left a grid where some cells have explosive coal (`true`) and others are empty (`false`).

The elves need your help to **map the dangerous areas**. Each empty cell should display a number indicating **how many explosive coal bombs there are in the adjacent positions**, including diagonals.

```js
detectBombs([
	[true, false, false],
	[false, true, false],
	[false, false, false],
])

/**
 * Expected result:
 *
 * [
 *  [1, 2, 1],
 *  [2, 1, 1],
 *  [1, 1, 1]
 * ]
 */

detectBombs([
	[true, false],
	[false, false],
])

/**
 * Expected result:
 *
 * [
 *  [0, 1],
 *  [1, 1]
 * ]
 */

detectBombs([
	[true, true],
	[false, false],
	[true, true],
])

/**
 * Expected result:
 *
 * [
 *  [1, 1],
 *  [4, 4],
 *  [1, 1]
 * ]
 */
```
