# Challenge 22

Santa Claus ðŸŽ… is checking a **list of unique toys that he might include in his magic gift bag**. He wants to explore all possible combinations of toys. He wants to see all combinations that actually contain at least one toy.

Your task is to write a function that, given an array of toys, **returns all possible combinations**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must return it in the order the toys appear and in combinations from 1 to n toys.

> [!NOTE] > **The input array will always have at least one toy and there will never be duplicate toys**.

> [!TIP]
> There are many ways to solve this problem, but backtracking might be a good option. ðŸ˜‰

```js
generateGiftSets(['car', 'doll', 'puzzle'])
/**

 *  ['car'],
 *  ['doll'],
 *  ['puzzle'],
 *  ['car', 'doll'],
 *  ['car', 'puzzle'],
 *  ['doll', 'puzzle'],
 *  ['car', 'doll', 'puzzle']
 * ]
 */

generateGiftSets(['ball'])
/**

 */

generateGiftSets(['game', 'pc'])
